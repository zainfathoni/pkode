## About `pkode`

### The problem

I open-source projects and want to make it easier to scaffold and maintain them.

### This solution

This package is a CLI that abstracts away all configuration for my open source
projects for linting, testing, building, and more.

## Inspiration

This tool is inspired by `react-scripts` and `kcd-scripts`.

### Why `pkode` name?

`pkode` is a short form of my pen name,
[Pejuang Kode](https://medium.com/pejuang-kode).

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) which is bundled
with [node](https://nodejs.org) and should be installed as one of your project's
`devDependencies`:

```shell
npm install --save-dev pkode
```

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `pkode`. I don't plan on documenting or
testing it super-duper well because it's really specific to my needs. You'll
find all available scripts in `src/scripts`.

This project tries to dogfoods itself. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll
find scripts with `node src {scriptName}`. This serves as an example of some of
the things you can do with `pkode`.

## More References

Not all of my implementation standards can be automated through scripts due to
certain reasons, such as
[the deprecation of conventional JS config in husky](https://blog.typicode.com/husky-git-hooks-javascript-config/).

Therefore, complement this repository with some guidelines and how-tos that all
contributors to my open-source projects can follow.

### Guidelines

#### Values

As guidance in making decisions, we hold on to [some values here](values.md)
that we adopted from

releases manually when things get messed up.
